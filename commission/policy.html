        <p>Hello, it's Moon.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you for your interest in commissioning me. Please read the following policies carefully before contacting me.</p>

        <br><br>

        <p><b>1.</b> I will not create NSFW, sexual, fetish, or otherwise explicit content. I am a minor, and any requests of this nature will be declined immediately.</p>

        <p><b>2.</b> I reserve the right to refuse any commission for any reason, including but not limited to content I am uncomfortable with, unclear requests, or disrespectful behavior.</p>

        <p><b>3.</b> All commissions must be clearly described before work begins. Major changes requested after work has started may result in additional fees or refusal.</p>

        <p><b>4.</b> Payment must be agreed upon before I begin working. I do not start commissions without confirmation.</p>

        <p><b>5.</b> Refunds are not guaranteed once work has started. If a commission is canceled mid-way, partial refunds may be considered depending on progress.</p>

        <p><b>6.</b> You may not claim my work as your own. Proper credit must be given unless otherwise agreed.</p>

        <p><b>7.</b> You may not resell, redistribute, or use my work for NFTs, AI training, or similar purposes without explicit written permission.</p>

        <p><b>8.</b> Deadlines are estimates, not guarantees. Delays may occur due to school, health, or personal reasons.</p>

        <p><b>9.</b> Harassment, pressure, or attempts to bypass these rules will result in immediate cancellation of the commission.</p>

        <p><b>10.</b> Your payment should be the following: Russian Rubles, Roblox Robux, Discord Nitro, Discord Boosts, Discord Decorations.</p>

        <p><b>11.</b> By commissioning me, you acknowledge and agree to all policies listed on this page.</p>
